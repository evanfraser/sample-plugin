# WordPress Sample Plugin

Please fork this project and then do the following:

1. Create WordPress plugin in `plugin.php` that:

    1.  Adds the Bootstrap JS / CSS to each page - use these URLs (https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/)
    2.  Replaces all instances of the word "dog" with the word "cat" in the content of all posts, but not pages.
    3.  Creates a shortcode called "quoter" that outputs a blockquote tag.  The text of the quote should be passed to the blockquote as the "quote" attribute of the shortcode and should be output within the blockquote tag.

1. Create a pull request to this repository with the WordPress plugin.
